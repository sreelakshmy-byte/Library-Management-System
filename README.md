Library Management System: Project Overview

Introduction:
The Library Management System (LMS) is designed to manage and streamline the various operations within a library. This system provides comprehensive functionality to handle information regarding books, branches, employees, customers, and the status of book issues and returns. It is designed to keep track of the libraryâ€™s collection, monitor book availability, manage customer interactions, and ensure that library operations run smoothly.

Database Structure:
The LMS database, named library, consists of six core tables:

Branch: This table stores information about the library branches, including the branch number, manager ID, branch address, and contact number.

Employee: This table contains details of the library employees, such as employee ID, name, position, salary, and the branch they are associated with. The Branch_no serves as a foreign key, linking employees to their respective branches.

Books: This table holds the details of the books available in the library, including the ISBN (primary key), title, category, rental price, availability status, author, and publisher.

Customer: This table records customer details, including customer ID, name, address, and registration date.

IssueStatus: This table tracks the status of books issued to customers. It includes details such as the issue ID, customer who issued the book, the date of issue, and the ISBN of the issued book.

ReturnStatus: This table manages the information related to the return of books, including the return ID, customer who returned the book, the return date, and the ISBN of the returned book.
